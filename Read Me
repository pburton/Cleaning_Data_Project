# Cleaning_Data_Project
This project contains the run_analysis.R and codebook for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning data project due on 27/12/15.

The run_analysis.r file will:

1. Read the lables and the feature information
2. Return only the standard deviation and mean of the features
3. Load the datasets and merge with the lables
4. Turn the activity and subjects into factors
5. Create the tidy dataset and output it to tidy.txt
